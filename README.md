## Face Recognition Using SQL
This project leverages SQL for face recognition, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of facial data. By implementing face recognition algorithms in SQL, this project explores the intersection of computer vision and database management, offering a unique approach to facial recognition tasks.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a face recognition system that utilizes SQL databases for storage and processing. By integrating SQL with computer vision techniques, we aim to create a scalable and efficient solution for face recognition tasks.

## Key Features
Facial Data Storage: Store facial features and metadata in SQL databases.
Facial Recognition Queries: Perform face recognition queries directly in SQL.
Scalability: Scale the system to handle large datasets of facial data.
Integration with Existing Systems: Integrate the face recognition system with other SQL-based applications.

## Technologies Used
SQL (Structured Query Language)
Python (for data preprocessing and interfacing with SQL databases)
OpenCV (for facial detection and feature extraction)

## Usage
Data Collection: Collect facial data and preprocess it using Python and OpenCV.
Database Setup: Create a SQL database schema to store facial features and metadata.
Data Insertion: Insert facial data into the SQL database.
Face Recognition: Perform face recognition queries using SQL queries.
Analysis and Visualization: Analyze and visualize facial recognition results using SQL and Python.
